// first of all load the data that we created in the previous file
// Extract features from the data into separate variables like it can be location ids and dates
// Extrct max min temperatures and humidity into separate variables
// We will have to make separate models for the predicting max temp min temp max hum and min humidity
// so basically there would be four models
// after loading the data we will train models
// like $maximum_temperture = new {write algorithm you are told to do}();
// $maximum_temperature->train(${extracted features}, ${max temperature variables})
// train like this for each of the  model
// save the models into the current directory
// moving towards iot.py
